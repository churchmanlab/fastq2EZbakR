# fastq2EZbakR

Reimplementation of the bam2bakR Snakemake workflow that makes several important improvements:

1. Better and more configurable preprocessing and alignment of fastq files
2. Fastq files are QCed with fastQC
3. Config file is more well organized and better documented
4. Lots of new functionality to ongoing/soon-to-be-preprinted work. Namely, it now implements a wide array of feature assignment strategies beyond "gene" and "gene-exon" assignment.

This pipeline will also be the site of exciting future development to expand the functionality of this pipeline, so stay tuned!
